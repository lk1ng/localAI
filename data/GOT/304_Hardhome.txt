"'''Hardhome'''" is the eighth episode of the fifth season of HBO's fantasy television series ''Game of Thrones'', and the 48th overall. The episode was written by the series' creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Miguel Sapochnik.

The episode features a climactic battle sequence at the episode's eponymous Wildling village, a battle mentioned but not seen in the original source material. It has since been hailed by many reviewers and fans as one of the series' best episodes. Filming of the episode's eponymous battle required nearly a month of shooting. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 7.01 million in its initial broadcast. The episode earned ''Game of Thrones'' several nominations at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards and was also Dinklage's pick to support his nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor.

This episode marks the only appearance for Birgitte Hjort Sørensen.

===Writing===
The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.
This episode was written by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the series' creators. It contains content from George Martin's novels ''A Feast for Crows'', chapters Cersei X and Cat of the Canals and ''A Dance with Dragons'', chapter The Ugly Little Girl.

Like other episodes this season, "Hardhome" contained a large amount of original material that does not appear in Martin's novels. This includes the battle scene in which the Wildlings and Night's Watch are ambushed by the White Walkers and army of the undead, as well as the meeting of Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister. According to Erik Kain of ''Forbes,'' "We have now fully parted ways with the books. If the rest of Season 5 hadn't convinced you that the show was forging its own path, this episode is the final nail in the coffin."

===Casting===
Birgitte Hjort Sørensen was cast as Karsi, a wildling chieftain originally written as a male character. Zachary Baharov appeared as Loboda, a Thenn leader, and Ross O'Hennessy replaced Edward Dogliani as the Lord Of Bones in this episode. Ian Whyte, who had previously been cast as a White Walker, played the giant. Members of the metal band Mastodon acted as wildlings at Hardhome in a cameo appearance.

===Filming===
Miguel Sapochnik served as director for the episode, his second episode for the series.
"Hardhome" was directed by Miguel Sapochnik. He joined the series as a director in the fifth season. He also directed the previous episode, "The Gift".
 The sequence at Hardhome was filmed at the Magheramorne quarry and took nearly a month to film.

==Reception==

"Hardhome" was watched by an estimated 7.01 million American viewers during its first airing.

In the United Kingdom, the episode was viewed by 2.383 million viewers, making it the highest-rated broadcast that week. It also received 0.211 million timeshift viewers.

===Critical reception===
The episode received universal acclaim from both critics and viewers, with critics calling it the best episode of the series. It received a 100% rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 35 reviews with an overall rating of 9.7 out of 10 and the critics' consensus reading "Following several episodes of setup, 'Hardhome' blends a sharp script with spectacular blockbuster action to offer viewers a powerful, game-changing payoff."

''The Atlantic'' named "Hardhome" one of the best television episodes of 2015. Erik Kain of ''Forbes'' called this "one of the best, most exciting episodes I've seen in the entire show's run, let alone this season," citing "High action and a series of pretty crazy revelations." Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode 10/10, labeling it a "masterpiece". He praised the Tyrion/Daenerys scenes but predominantly the final sequence, which he described as "edge-of-your-seat exciting" and also "quite terrifying". This made "Hardhome" the first episode in season 5 to receive a 10/10 rating from IGN. Matt Fowler also named it the best episode of the entire series. Both Myles McNutt and Erik Adams of ''The A.V. Club'' gave the episode the website's highest grade, "A". They called it "a welcome reminder that the show is still unpredictable," with McNutt citing it as his favorite episode of the series thus far. Bridle Roman of SFX gave the episode a perfect five stars, and highlighted the character of Karsi, played by Birgitte Hjort Sørensen, as a great addition and "her death hits hard" even if "we have only seen her for a few scenes". The episode received praise even from some of its usual critics: Madeline Davies of ''Jezebel'' wrote, "I feel like I haven't said this in a long time, but last night's ''Game of Thrones'' was ...cool?" Davies cited the quality of the battle scene and unifying theme of hope in desperate situations as the episode's key strengths, specifically that the abused and tormented Sansa learns that her brothers may still be alive and that though Jon faces "the seemingly impossible task of defeating a constantly growing army of White Walkers, he at least possesses a sword that can kill them." Kirsten Acuna of ''Business Insider'' reports that this is the single most popular episode to date as rated by fans, noting that the "tremendous reaction is in complete juxtaposition with reactions to an episode that aired two weeks ago," which received one of the series' lowest fan ratings. Acuna credits this response to the quality of the battle scene, which featured "a fighting army of the walking dead which would easily give the AMC series of the same name a run for its money."
