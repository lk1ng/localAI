"'''Valar Morghulis'''" is the tenth and final episode of the second season of the HBO medieval fantasy television series ''Game of Thrones''. It is the sixth episode of season 2 to be written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and is directed by Alan Taylor, his fourth episode of the season. The episode is 64 minutes long and aired on June 3, 2012.

The episode's title is a code phrase spoken by Jaqen H'ghar to Arya Stark during the episode, but its meaning is not explained until the third season episode "Walk of Punishment": "All men must die." This is consistent with the meaning given in the books upon which the series is based.

This episode marks the final appearance of Jason Momoa (Khal Drogo).

Robb confides to Catelyn that he loves Talisa and will not proceed with the arranged marriage to House Frey. Despite Catelyn's warning, Robb marries Talisa.

===In the Riverlands===
Fleeing Harrenhal, Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are surprised by Jaqen, who offers to train Arya in his abilities, but she declines. He gives her a special coin and the phrase "''Valar morghulis''" to use to find him, and reveals his face-changing ability before departing.
