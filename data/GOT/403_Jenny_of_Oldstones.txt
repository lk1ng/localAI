"'''Jenny of Oldstones'''", alternatively titled "'''Jenny's Song'''", is a song appearing in the HBO TV series ''Game of Thrones''. It was included in two separate parts in the second episode of the series' eighth season, "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms". In the first instance of the song, it was performed during the episode by character Podrick Payne, portrayed by Scottish actor Daniel Portman. The song then played during the episode's end credits, performed by British indie rock band Florence and the Machine. Florence and the Machine released the song as a single the day after the episode aired, on 22 April 2019. The song was released by HBO and record label Universal Music Group.

==Background==
"Jenny of Oldstones" is an adaptation of a song mentioned in George R. R. Martin's fantasy novel series ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', on which ''Game of Thrones'' is based. In the third novel in the series, ''A Storm of Swords'', a character asks for "my Jenny's song" to be performed. Only one line of the song is quoted in the novel itself: "High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts." In the fictional history of the world of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', the titular Jenny of Oldstones was a commoner whom a prince gave up his inheritance to marry. 

The song was written by German composer Ramin Djawadi, who composes the music for ''Game of Thrones'', and screenwriters D. B. Weiss and David Benioff, who added lyrics to the fragment written in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' by Martin. Florence and the Machine's recording of it was produced by American musician Doveman and Florence and the Machine frontwoman Florence Welch. The song is a folk ballad, with influences of Celtic music. Weiss and Benioff reportedly approached Welch in 2012 to record the song "The Rains of Castamere", although she had turned down their request. Following the release of "Jenny of Oldstones", Welch stated in an interview with ''The New York Times'' that this was during her "wild years", when she was "less focused".

In the episode "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms", the recording of the song by Welch was played over the closing credits. The song was however first heard performed by Daniel Portman as the character Podrick, who sang a verse in a sequence reminiscent of the scene in ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' when Pippin sang "The Edge of Night" before the battle of Minas Tirith. The version sung by Portman is a simplified in its harmonies, while the version by Welch is close to how Djawadi originally wrote it with more chord changes.

==Commercial performance==
"Jenny of Oldstones" debuted at number 75 in the UK and 64 in Ireland. It was the seventh best-selling digital song the week it was released in the United States. In Belgium, the song did not enter the Ultratop 50 or Ultratip 50, but did appear on the Flemish extra tips chart.
