''Game of Thrones'' is an American  fantasy drama television series created for HBO by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels. The story takes place on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, it has several plot lines and a large ensemble cast. The first story arc follows a dynastic conflict among competing claimants for succession to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The second covers attempts to reclaim the throne by the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty; the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.

The series, mostly written by Benioff, Weiss and Martin, has been nominated for many awards, including six Golden Globe Awards (one win), ten Writers Guild of America Awards, seven Producers Guild of America Awards (one win), eight Directors Guild of America Awards (two wins), eight Art Directors Guild Awards (five wins), twenty one Saturn Awards (two wins), fourteen Satellite Awards (three wins), and one Peabody Award. The series has received 160 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including eight consecutive Outstanding Drama Series nominations, with 59 wins to date. ''Game of Thrones'' received many nominations, with awards recognizing various aspects of the series such as directing, writing, cast, visual effects, or overall quality.

Peter Dinklage is the most awarded member of the cast, with recognitions such as the Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Series. In addition, cast members Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Maisie Williams, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Alfie Allen, Sophie Turner, Gwendoline Christie, Carice van Houten, Diana Rigg, and Max von Sydow received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for their performances in the series. The rest of the cast was also very praised, many receiving various awards nominations, including six Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series nominations rewarding all of the main cast for seasons 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. In 2015, it set a record for winning the most number of Primetime Emmy Awards for a series in a single year, with 12 wins out of 24 nominations. In 2016, it became the most awarded series in Emmy Awards history, with a total of 38 wins. To date, ''Game of Thrones'' has won 308 awards out of 628 nominations.
