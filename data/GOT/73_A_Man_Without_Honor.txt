The episode is written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss and directed, for the second time in this season, by David Nutter. It premiered on May 13, 2012.

Tyrion tells Cersei his doubts about Joffrey's plan to repel Stannis’ fleet. Cersei confesses her belief that Joffrey is punishment for her incest with Jaime.

===In the Westerlands===
Robb hears Alton Lannister's unfavorable reply to the peace terms brought to Cersei and, with his prisons full, orders Alton placed with Jaime. Talisa agrees to accompany Robb to the Crag for medical supplies.
