==Background==

"It's been such an honor to be a part of this incredible show for the past eight years", said Ramin Djawadi.

Djawadi says of his track "The Night King": "When I talked to Miguel Sapochnik|Miguel Sapochnik, the director, and when David Benioff|David Benioff and D. B. Weiss|D. B. Weiss came to my studio and we started working on this episode, we all agreed that it had to be a piano piece again, just like 'Light of the Seven'.... It definitely misled the audience because of what they knew from 'Light of the Seven', back in season six. We always treated the music as another character in the show."
