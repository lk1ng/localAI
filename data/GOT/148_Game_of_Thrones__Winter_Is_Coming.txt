'''''Game of Thrones: Winter is Coming''''' is a new videogame published in 2019, based on the ''Game of Thrones'' television series and the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' books.

On 26 March 2019, Chinese studio Yoozoo Games announced the global launch of ''Game of Thrones Winter is Coming'', a real-time strategy browser game officially licensed by Warner Bros, under license from HBO.

The player takes the part of the king of one of the seven kingdoms of Westeros, and he has to try to conquer the other six kingdoms, or to unify them by stopping wars which are current between them.

YouTube advertisements for this game seem to say that game activity includes not only fighting and war, but also increasing food production (cultivating land, herding sheep, fishing, picking fruit), mining metal ore, having weapons made, felling timber and making buildings, and training men.

In the game, a dragon can be obtained, as an egg, which can be hatched, and the hatchling can be raised through its juvenile stage to being big enough to be useful in battle.

The game starts after Eddard Stark dies. It takes some days to play it to completion.
