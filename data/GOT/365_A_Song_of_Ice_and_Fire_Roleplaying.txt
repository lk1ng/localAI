'''''A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying''''' is a role-playing game published by Green Ronin Publishing in 2009.

==Description==
''A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying'' is an adaptation of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novel series.  The game uses Green Ronin's "Chronicle System".

==Publication history==
On 24 April 2007, it was on George R.R. Martin's website that Green Ronin Publishing was producing a new line of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' RPG products, unrelated to the earlier Guardians of Order ''A Game of Thrones'' effort. Robert J. Schwalb designed the ''A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying'' game, which was previewed in 2008 and published in 2009; this was his last project for Green Ronin before he moved over to Wizards of the Coast. The Green Ronin game, titled ''A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying'' (''SIFRP''), went on sale on 10 March 2009: it uses a custom game system and does not contain rules from either the d20 or Tri-Stat dX systems.

==Reception==
''A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying'' won the 2009 Silver ENnie Award for Best Rules.
