The '''Iron Throne''' is a metonym for the fictional monarchy of Westeros as well as the physical throne of its monarch in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin. The success of the HBO television adaptation ''Game of Thrones'' has made the show's version of the royal seat an icon of the entire media franchise. Martin said in 2013,  "Say ''Game of Thrones'', and people think of the HBO Iron Throne."

Martin called the depiction of the throne in his 2014 ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' companion book ''The World of Ice & Fire'' "absolutely right". He has noted repeatedly that none of the previous media representations of the throne—including books, games and the TV series—closely resemble what he had in mind when writing his novels.

==''A Song of Ice and Fire''==
In the series, the Iron Throne is both a physical seat of office as well as a metonym for the monarchy of Westeros. Martin establishes in ''A Game of Thrones'' (1996) that after seizing control of six of the Seven Kingdoms, Targaryen ruler Aegon the Conqueror had made a throne for himself from the swords of his vanquished enemies, fused by dragonfire. Aegon had established King's Landing as the royal capital, and the Iron Throne itself sits in the Red Keep. Martin writes that according to legend, Aegon kept the blades sharp so that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne; it is a common belief that such rulers are therefore unfit to rule.

===Description===
Purportedly made from a thousand swords and knives, the Iron Throne is a massive and asymmetrical tangle of jagged and twisted blades, in which reclining is impossible.



Martin commented in 2014:



===Depictions===
The Iron Throne has been depicted in comic books, in games, and on book covers, but Martin has noted repeatedly that none of these representations coincided with what he imagined:



To Martin, the attempt closest to his vision was by French artist Marc Simonetti, for a Mexican edition of ''A Game of Thrones''. The author subsequently worked with Simonetti to get an image the author calls "absolutely right". This depiction appears in Martin's 2014 companion book ''The World of Ice & Fire''. He noted, "From now on, THIS will be the reference I give to every other artist tackling a throne room scene." Martin said of the image:

==Television adaptation==
The HBO television adaptation of the series, ''Game of Thrones'', premiered in 2011. The design of the Iron Throne for the show was conceived by its production designer Gemma Jackson, and the prop maker Gavin Jones constructed the piece. The show's popularity has made its version of the throne an icon of the entire media franchise. It has been parodied in magazines and used in merchandising. Several "promotional thrones" travel the world with show-sponsored exhibits and for fan events. In June 2014, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Belfast set of ''Game of Thrones'' and was photographed examining the Iron Throne set piece from the series, though she declined to sit on it.

Though Martin had previously stated that the HBO version of the Iron Throne did not match his idea of how it should appear ideally, in 2013 he called its design "terrific" and claimed to own all of the merchandised replicas. He added:



Of the feasibility of recreating the throne as depicted in ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Martin said in October 2014:
