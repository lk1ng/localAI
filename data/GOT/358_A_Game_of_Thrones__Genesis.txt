'''''A Game of Thrones: Genesis''''' is a strategy video game developed by Cyanide and published by Focus Home Interactive released exclusively for Microsoft Windows on September 28, 2011 in North America (only on Steam), September 29, 2011 in Europe and October 13, 2011 in Australia.

The game is an adaptation of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' book series by George R. R. Martin and is the first such video game adaptation. The game takes place over 1,000 years of the fictional history of Westeros, beginning with the arrival of the Rhoynar led by the warrior-queen Nymeria.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay focuses on capturing nodes—castles, towns and goldmines—with characters. Emphasis is placed on the rock-paper-scissors mechanics of "underhanded" characters rather than the brute force combat strength of traditional realtime strategy games.

The goal of the game is to win the Iron Throne and doing so can be done by amassing enough 'prestige' within the game.

Each house has special units and abilities. House Stark has direwolves and House Baratheon has better archers for example.

The game has two modes of play: Versus and Campaign. The game features four main facets: diplomacy, military, economic, and underhand.



==Reception==


''A Game of Thrones: Genesis'' received "mixed" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
