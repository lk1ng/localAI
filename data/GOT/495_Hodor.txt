== Character description ==
===Novels===
Hodor is a simple-minded stable-boy at Winterfell. He is popularly known as Hodor because that is the only word he is capable of saying. His height is described as over seven feet tall, and it is hinted that he may have giant ancestry. He has a friendly, childlike disposition and possesses great strength, although he is reluctant to use it against others. After Bran Stark is crippled in ''A Game of Thrones'', Hodor is employed to carry him in a sling on his back. Old Nan (Hodor's great-grandmother) reveals to Bran that Hodor's real name is Walder. When Winterfell is destroyed, Hodor escapes to the north with Bran, Jojen, Meera, Rickon, and Osha.

===Television===
Hodor is portrayed by Kristian Nairn in the television adaptation; it was his first acting role. Hodor is a huge, physically strong and intellectually disabled stablehand at Winterfell who can only say the word "Hodor". Nairn developed 70 ways of saying the word, also using body language to distinguish them.

===Season 2===
Hodor hides in the crypts with Osha, Bran, and Rickon, who all fake their escape out of the castle. They eventually leave the crypts only to find the castle destroyed. After speaking to the dying Maester Luwin, the group decides they must go to the Wall.

===Season 3===
Bran decides to go beyond the Wall to find the Three-eyed-raven, and Hodor, Meera, and Jojen Reed help him after Rickon and Osha depart. 

===Season 4===
Bran, Hodor, Meera, and Jojen stumble across Craster's Keep, where they are captured by the Night's Watch mutineers led by Karl. Hodor is chained to a post and is abused by some mutineers, who poke him with spears and eventually stab him in the leg to stop him from intervening on Bran's behalf. Hodor is later chained in a hut with the other prisoners, and when Bran is abducted by Locke, Bran skinchanges into (possesses) Hodor and uses him to kill Locke by snapping his neck. Hodor frees the others, and they escape and eventually reach the three-eyed raven in his cave.

===Season 6===
Bran learns through visions of the past that, as a boy, Hodor was named Wylis and possessed normal abilities of speech. When the cave is overrun by White Walkers and wights while Bran is viewing the past, Bran wargs into Hodor to induce him to carry Bran to safety. Once they exit through a passageway, Meera orders Hodor to "hold the door" against the wights; in the past, before Bran was born, Wyllis is shown to have collapsed and repeated this phrase until it slurred into "Hodor." In the present, Hodor holds the door until he is killed as the wights eventually tear through the door, but he buys sufficient time for Meera to escape with Bran. 

==Legacy==
Hodor rarely ever says any word other than "Hodor". However, according to Kristian Nairn's interview with ''Vulture'', he has developed 70 ways to say it.
