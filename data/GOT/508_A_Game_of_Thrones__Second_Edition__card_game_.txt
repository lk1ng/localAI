'''''A Game of Thrones: The Card Game Second Edition''''' (or '''''AGoT''''', for short) is a Living Card Game (LCG) produced by Fantasy Flight Games. It is based on ''A Song of Ice and Fire'',  a series of novels written by George R. R. Martin.  The second edition of this LCG, it is not backwards compatible with the first edition that preceded it.

In the game, players assume the leadership of one of the great houses of Westeros vying for control of King's Landing and the Iron Throne. To accomplish this, players launch military attacks against their opponents, undermine their opponentsâ€™ plans with intrigues of their own, and make power plays to win the support of the realm.
