The soundtrack album for the second season of HBO series ''Game of Thrones'', titled '''''Game of Thrones: Season 2''''', was published on June 19, 2012. The instrumental music by Ramin Djawadi was performed by the Czech Film Orchestra and Choir and recorded at the Rudolfinum concert hall in Prague.

==Reception==
The soundtrack received mostly positive reviews. ''Tracksounds''s review was again mixed, describing the score as little more than adequate. Noting a lack of thematic development or dramatic momentum, the reviewer nonetheless appreciated the score's more subdued moments, which he considered less forced than the rest of the track.
