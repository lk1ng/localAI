==Plot==
===In King's Landing===
Meeting with Olenna, Tywin threatens to appoint Loras to the Kingsguard, thereby renouncing his right to inheritance and marriage and leaving House Tyrell without a male heir, and Olenna consents to Loras and Cersei's marriage.

Tyrion accuses Cersei of trying to have him killed during the Battle of the Blackwater, but deduces it was Joffrey who ordered his death and Cersei tells him he is not in danger now that Tywin is the Hand. Tyrion informs Sansa that she will not wed Loras, but himself.

Baelish tells Varys he has given Ros to Joffrey to kill for his pleasure. Sansa watches tearfully as Baelish departs by ship, losing her chance at leaving the capital.

===In the Riverlands===
Arriving at the Brotherhood's hideout, Melisandre is shocked to learn of Beric's six resurrections, and takes Gendry into her custody. Arya unnerves Melisandre, who declares Arya will "shut many eyes forever" and they will meet again.

At Riverrun, Robb and his advisors discuss an alliance with Lame Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers. Lord Walder Frey's demands include a formal apology from Robb, the castle Harrenhal, and for Edmure to marry one of his daughters.

===At Harrenhal===
Roose Bolton agrees to send Jaime to King's Landing if Jaime assures Tywin that Bolton had nothing to do with his maiming, but keeps Brienne under arrest for abetting treason.

===In the North===
Bran defuses tensions between Osha and Meera, and Jojen tells Bran his vision of Jon surrounded by enemies.

Torturing Theon, the boy threatens to sever his finger if he cannot guess the boy's identity and their location. After his finger is flayed for several wrong guesses, Theon guesses the boy is a Karstark and he is being tortured at the Karhold for betraying Robb. The boy pretends Theon was correct before continuing to flay his finger, admitting his torture is solely for his amusement. Theon finally begs his torturer to remove his finger.

===Beyond the Wall===
En route to the Wall, Sam shows Gilly the dragonglass dagger he found and tells her about Castle Black.

Ygritte reveals she is aware Jon remains loyal to the Night's Watch, but tells him their loyalty to each other is greater. As Tormund's party climbs the wall, Ygritte inadvertently causes an avalanche that kills some wildlings and leaves her and Jon hanging by their rope. Before Orell cuts the rope, Jon secures himself to the Wall and reaches the top with Ygritte, where they embrace.

==Production==
The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.
